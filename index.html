            <h2>BIO</h2>
            <p>I am a reliable, creative professional, mobile development expert specializing in native iOS/Android apps and backend service/BaaS platform integration.</p>
          </div>
          <p>In the past several years I have built many iOS and Android applications, with a focus on Maps, GIS, GPS, PUSH, and geospatial data as well as experience in information management and presentation. My core ability is complete engineering of mobile applications from the ground up, choosing an appropriate database, logic, and UI technologies from the array of existing options.
          </p>

          <p>I have used backend integration with REST service as well as direct DB calls, used BaaS platforms like Firebase/QuickBlox, Geolocation, Geo-fencing, Payment integration, facebook/twitter/Instagram/foursquare integration, and a lot of other technologies in the iOS apps.

        <h2>Fun Facts About Me</h2>
        <p>Everyone has a story, right? Well first off, Hi - I'm Tony Kuria. When I'm not working, I love to keep it active. Football, Basketball, the gym, you name it. Being healthy is extremely important to me. I strongly believe that if you keep your mental game strong, this reflects strongly in your professional life as well. Friends and family are probably the biggest part of my life too.
